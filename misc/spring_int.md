# Spring Integration

## Current versions of spring and spring-integration on my application

spring.verion = 4.1.1.RELEASE

spring-integration version = 4.1.6.RELEASE

java = 1.7

Objective:

- build with maven
- deploy application

Overall plan:

- build with maven
- get a jar file
- copy jar file to the deployment folder
- copy changes java-classes to the deplay ment folder
- probably copying the whole classes folder will be enough
